# LendingLibraryTester

This code is simply planning and preliminary testing to anticipate issues that might arise with models or transactions in a project that is still in the planning phase.
  
  App Description:
    This app should track the status, condition and location of resources lent to local schools, with a separate area for borrowers and lenders.  
    
    User Stories (including stretch): Borrower
      1. I can view resources in a list sorted by age group, grade level, category or filtered by tags.
      2. I can view details and download documentation for each resource and have access to checkout transactions and status information from this view.
      3. I can view history of checkouts and status of current checkout from my profile page.
      4. I receive an email notification when an item is almost due and optional email notifications for other events (such as favorited items becoming available).
      5. I can communicate with lender by filling in a message form.
      6. I can leave feedback about items that my class has checked out.
